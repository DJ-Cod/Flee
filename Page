  <p> You get up and run. You do not look back. As you are running, you can feel your legbeing grazed by the animals teeth. This just motivates you to run faster. Faster than yu ever have before. </p>
  <p> As you run, you see the area moving around you extremely quickly. It's almost as if... you're in a car. </p>
  <p> You slow down to a stop. You realize that you have traveled miles from where you were standing in that lake. </p> 
  <p> You don't know what to do with this newfound power, and you don't know why it was given to you, but you feel like it will never leave you. </p>
